According to a review of 58 studies, resistance training for at least 4 weeks may help decrease body fat by an average of 1.46%. It may also significantly reduce body fat mass and visceral fat, which is a type of fat that surrounds the organs in your belly.
                        Another study showed that 5 months of strength training was more effective at reducing body fat in adolescents with obesity than aerobic exercise alone</Label>

In fact, multiple studies have associated eating more high quality protein with a lower risk of excess body fat and obesity.
Other research indicates that a high protein diet may help preserve muscle mass and metabolism during weight loss.

In fact, several studies associate sufficient sleep with weight loss.
One 10-year study linked sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night to a higher risk of obesity among young women.

For example, sugar-sweetened beverages like soda are often packed with calories and offer little nutritional value. Alcohol is also high in calories and may lower inhibitions, which may increase your risk of overeating.
Studies have associated drinking both sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol with a higher risk of excess belly fat.
Instead, opt for calorie-free beverages like water or green tea.</Label>

Adding cardio to your routine may be one of the most effective ways to enhance fat burning and weight loss.
